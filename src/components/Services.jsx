            <h4 className>Free Medical Monitoring</h4>
            <p>
              Nurses work in our gym and play a key role in monitoring your
              health. Every month, for free, they monitor your heart and
              circulatory system, weigh you, and chart your body fat percentage.
              They use computer estimates to determine your body age, which
              decreases month to month, as your other fitness components
              improve. These benefits are all provided free of charge.

            <h4>Free InBody Screenings</h4>
            <p>
              In less than 60 seconds, the InBody Screening not only examines
              the composition of your body, but also reveals percentage of body
              fat, muscle distribution, and body water balance which are
              components that are key in understanding more about your body. The
              inBody Test gives you a true and complete assessment of your body,
              allowing you to track your progress accurately. Go beyond the
              scale and see what youâ€™re made of.
